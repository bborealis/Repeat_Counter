# _Count Repeats_

##### _Evaluates how frequently a word appears in a given string. , 8/14/2015_

#### By Brian Borealis

## Description

_User inputs a single word and a string of words and gets back how many times the single word appears in the string.  **(exp. input_single: "how", input_words: "How are you? How am I? How can you." and output prints: "3")**_

## Setup

When installing from source you may notice that once you have cloned this repo, that this project makes use of a PHP Dependency Manager: [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer). Once you have Composer installed you can acquire any project dependencies via your shell by entering:

```
$ composer install
```

_You then only need to start up a local PHP server from within the "web" directory within the project's folder and point your browser to whatever local host server you have created._  

## Technologies Used

_This project makes use of PHP, the testing framework [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), the micro-framework [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), and uses [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates._

## To Do

_Get final test to pass: searching for nothing results in "Please enter a word"._
